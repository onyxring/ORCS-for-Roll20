# ORCS for Roll20
This is a rollup of all individual "OnyxRing Client Scripts for Roll20".  These scripts are designed to be included in Roll20 character sheets, either individually or as a complete, client-side library.

Documentation for the individual, stand-alone scripts can be found in their corresponding repositories.

* [Roll20Async](https://github.com/onyxring/Roll20Async)      -  Enables the attribute access in SheetWorkers while using JavaScript Promises and within the callbacks of setTimeout() and setIntervals().
* [orcsCharacter](https://github.com/onyxring/orcsCharacter)    -  Introduces a significantly improved syntax for accessing the character's attributes, including Repeated Sections, via property objects.  Depends on the Roll20Async script.
